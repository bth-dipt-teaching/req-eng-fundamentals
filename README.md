## Overview

*Requirements Engineering: a brief introduction* is a very brief summary of the most important concepts of requirements engineering (RE) and their application. It was originally developed as a guest lecture for a software engineering (SE) course to provide Bachelor level students with a general overview of (RE) theory [1] and techniques [2]. The material does not require any prior knowledge about RE, but assumes a basic understanding of SE process models.
